# Hardware
### What is VR and How is it Different from Other Media?
1. Fred Brooks: the experience in which the user is effectively immersed in a responsive virtual world.
2. 3D Stereovision, user dynamic control of viewpoint, and a surrounding experience.
3. Overwhelming and persistent.
4. Haptic feedback.

### Hardware
1. Displays: HDM and CAVE.

2. Head tracking: track head's position and rotation.
3. Controllers: track head's position, rotation + navigation.

# History
1. VR in the Analogue Age.
2. VR in the Digital Age.

# VR Technical
1. Components: VR display, VR content and VR interaction.
2. Being Someone Else: Proprioception Match ([Be another lab](http://beanotherlab.org/home/work/tmtba/)).

# Immersion
One system is more immersive than another if the first can be used to simulate the second.  
Way to describe the system in itself, it's not describing people's responses.
### Sensory motor contingency
1. Set of implicit rules, whereby we use our body to perceive the world across all the different senses.
2. How you perceive and what you perceive.
### Three Illusions
2. Place illusion.
1. Plausibility illusion.
3. Embodiment illusion: The Pinocchio Illusion, The Rubber Hand Illusion (proprioception).  
[This is where Prof Mel Slater's theory on the three illusions was first published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781884/)

# Challenges in VR
### Challenges in rendering realistic looking graphics
Basic Concepts in 3D Computer Graphics:  
1. [Diffuse reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_reflection)
2. [Specular reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection)
3. [Global illumination](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GIIntro.html)

### Challenges in creating realistic and believable animations

### Navigation
Physical navigation, Walk in place, Virtual navigation, Teleporting.

### Nausea
1. Simulation sickness
2. The conflict between information received in the brain from our vestibular system and our visual system
3. Simulation sickness != Motion sickness
4. Call by VR?
5. Haptic Feedback.
